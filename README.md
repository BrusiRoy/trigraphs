Reading that trigraphs were being [removed from C++17](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4086.html), gave me the idea to make a tool to convert a _normal_ C/C++ program to a _trigraphed_ version of the same program.

Everything here was compiled using the `clang` compiler version `3.8.1`.

You can do `make compile` do compile the tool.
